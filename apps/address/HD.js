 *
 * Creative Commons Legal Code
 *
 * CC0 1.0 Universal
 *
 * CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL
 * SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT
 * RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS.
 * CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR
 * THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR
 * DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
 * PROVIDED HEREUNDER.
 *
 * Statement of Purpose
 *
 * The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 * exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
 * subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
 * authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 *
 * Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
 * purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
 * works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
 * claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
 * and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
 * purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
 * contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
 * further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
 * reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
 * efforts of others.
 *
 * For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
 * of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with
 * a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of
 * Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to
 * the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of
 * his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and
 * intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
 *
 * 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 * protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
 * Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
 * to, the following:
 *
 * i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
 * and translate a Work; ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s)
 * and/or performer(s); iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a
 * person's image or likeness depicted in a Work; iv. rights protecting against
 * unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in
 * paragraph 4(a), below; v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination,
 * use and reuse of data in a Work; vi. database rights (such as those arising
 * under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
 * March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national
 * implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
 * directive); and vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights
 * throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
 * implementations thereof.
 *
 * 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
 * applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
 * unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
 * and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
 * known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
 * action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
 * duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
 * extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
 * copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
 * commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer
 * makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to
 * the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such
 * Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
 * termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
 * enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express
 * Statement of Purpose.
 *
 * 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
 * judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
 * shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
 * Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
 * Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
 * royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable
 * and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights
 * in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
 * provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions),
 * (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)
 * for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
 * advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be
 * deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work.
 * Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or
 * ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness
 * shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer
 * hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her
 * remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any
 * associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either
 * case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 *
 * 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 *
 * a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
 * surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document. b. Affirmer
 * offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind
 * concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including
 * without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
 * particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other
 * defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
 * discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law. c.
 * Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that
 * may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any
 * person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
 * disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or
 * other rights required for any use of the Work. d. Affirmer understands and
 * acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no
 * duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.
